This repository contains tools, guidance, and examples useful for those interested (or maybe gullible enough) in reporting electronic-crime (e-Crime) events from their environment to others. These events could be data items of incidents, threats, or observations, or even cool tools. The examples and guidance support multiple flavours of the event format of the day; pick your favourite.


Suggestion for more examples (particularly with an exampleencoded) are always welcome.

The taxonomy repository contains current output of a small group witthin the APWWG (apwg.org) that is trying to define an e-Crime taxonomy.
