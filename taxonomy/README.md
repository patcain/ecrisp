The never-ending e-Crime taxonomy project...
The history of the adventure is in the document labeled patsTaxonomy.(docx|pdf)
The base graphic is a mindmap (.mm) which may require a special tool to edit, and is located in the Crime Mindmap4-1.mm document. 
The mindmap and current work is incorporated within the taxonomy4.(docx|pdf) document.
The work is ongoing as time and new ideas permit.  New ideas or contributons are always welcome.
