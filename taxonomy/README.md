**The never-ending e-Crime taxonomy project...**

The idea was to get a group of crimefighters together to try and agree on terms and supply educational material so we would all speaketh the same language when dealing with the public.
 
The history of the adventure is in the document labeled patsTaxonomy.(docx|pdf)
The base graphic is a mindmap (.mm) which may require a special tool to edit, and is located in the Crime Mindmap4-1.mm document. 

The mindmap and current work is incorporated within the taxonomy4.(docx|pdf) document.

The work is ongoing as time and new ideas permit.  New ideas or contributons are always welcome.
